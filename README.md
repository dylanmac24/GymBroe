# GymBroe 

GymBroe is a SwiftUI iOS app I built to track gym workouts, personal bests, and training progression.
The gym is something I am extremely passionate about so it felt only right to incorporate it into my coding.

I created it because I wanted a simple, clean tracker focused on progressive overload and long-term progress. 
I found most apps on the appstore either require a subscription or in-app fees, so I decided to make my own.
